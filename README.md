#Lynda CMS

Status: In-Progress

This is the project from following through Lynda's 12-hour <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Ruby-Rails-4-Essential-Training/139989-2.html">Ruby on Rails 4 Essential Training</a> course.

Not the prettiest looking project, but does a great job of covering all of the aspects one needs to build a complete (if a little basic) Rails project. Great for reference.
